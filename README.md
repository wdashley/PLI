# PLI Extras #

This repository is dedicated to providing extra routines and procedures
for the [Iron Spring PL/I] [L1] on the Linux platform. The repository is 
divided up into several section which include:

[L1]: http://www.iron-spring.com/


1. include -  all include files should be placed here.
2. libfuncspli - all functions and procedure that require the C runtime
   library (either static or dynamic) should be placed here.
3. libstdpli - all functions and procedures that do NOT require the C
   runtime library should be placed here.
4. man - all man pages that document your functions and procedures
   should be placed here.

More subdirectories could be added later.

Everyone is invited to contribute to this effort. If you have something you
wish to contribute just [contact me] [L2] and we can arrange 
to get your code included in the repository.

[L2]: w.david.ashley@gmail.com

Currently this repository contains routines that add file system functions,
additional string functions, date and time routines, and some other
miscellaneous functions. I have plans to add more as I create them.

Your feedback on this repository would be really helpful. Just drop me
an email and we can discuss it. Also, if you have suggestions for
routines you would like to see included, that would also be helpful.

This repository has been created in the hope that others will find the code
useful. I always hate to recreate code that has been lost or misplaced.
At least now ther is a place to put this code where it will be safe for
the forseeable future.
